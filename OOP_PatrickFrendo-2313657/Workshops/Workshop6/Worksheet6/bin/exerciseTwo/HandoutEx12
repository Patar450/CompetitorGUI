Which container would you choose in the following situations? Give reasons.
1. To keep a record of the English names of types of birds that I saw in my 
garden within a 10 minute period, in order of occurrence. I will just add a bird 
name whenever I see the bird.
E.g. bluetit, bluetit, robin, blackbird, robin, bluetit

LinkedList, as it'll allow the user to keep record of the birds in order of occurance
without changing the structure of the list regardless of duplicates.

2. To keep a record of the English names of each type of bird that I have ever 
seen in my garden. I just want names, in alphabetic order. I want to add a bird 
whenever I see one. As the list grows, I might not remember whether a bird is 
a new bird or one that I have already seen.
E.g. blackbird, bluetit, robin, thrush

TreeSet, more precisely SortedSet to automatically arrange the items in ascending order.
One problem that might cause is that it will not allow user to store duplicate items.

3. As (2) above, but once I add the bird, I want to keep other details about that 
type of bird (e.g. latin name, average lifespan) and I want to be able to look 
them up by name. I donâ€™t need them in any particular order. 

HashMap, and use the bird name as the key and the rest of the details into objects. 

4. As (3) above. What if I did want to print details in some order?
TreeMap, and use the bird name as the key again but using TreeMap will also allow the user
to print details in any given order.
